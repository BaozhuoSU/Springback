# Springback
This repo aims to demonstrate the theoretical part and codes used of springback error optimization project,  which is my internship project in LINKCONN Electronics. This project mainly contains two parts:

- Theoretical part, demonstrating how we applied mathmatical model to our project,i.e., bilevel optimization and stochastic modeling etc.
- Codes, demonstrating how we do experiments and simulation, including data preprocess, model training and tuning, results visualization and analysis etc.

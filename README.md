# Springback Error Optimization

> A comprehensive showcase of the mathematical models and codebase used to minimize springback error, developed during my internship at **LINKCONN Electronics**.

---

## ðŸ§® Theoretical Foundations
- **Bilevel Optimization**  
  - Formulated the springback minimization as a nested (upperâ€“lower) decision problem.  
  - Derived optimal control variables at the lower level, subject to upper-level design constraints.
- **Stochastic Modeling**  
  - Modeled variability in material properties and process conditions with probabilistic distributions.  
  - Applied Monte Carlo sampling to estimate error distributions and robustify the solution.

## ðŸ’» Implementation & Experiments
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning and normalization of measurement datasets  
   - Feature extraction and augmentation scripts  
2. **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Automated pipelines using `scikit-learn` and `Optuna`  
   - Cross-validation and grid/random search for optimal parameters  
3. **Simulation & Results Analysis**  
   - Jupyter notebooks for running batch simulations  
   - Visualization of error reduction, convergence plots, and sensitivity analyses
